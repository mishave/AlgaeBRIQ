# Entites that can be set up in the configuration.yaml file
## input_boolean
These are used for switches as either on or off - https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/input_boolean/
```diff
input_boolean:
  Switch1:              #name of entity
    initial: off        #intial state when first turned on
  Switch2:              #name of entity
    name: 2nd Switch    #friendly name that will show up on dashboard inplace of entity name
    icon: mdi:car       #set the icon to something else other then default - see: https://materialdesignicons.com/
    initial: off        #intial state when first turned on
```
when you call and input_boolean it will be address i.e. `input_boolean.Switch1`
In appdeamon this can be called by `self.get_state("input_boolean.pbr_auto_man")` This will return a 'on' or 'off'
to convert to a int/byte you can do the following:
```
Switch1_State = self.get_state("input_boolean.Switch1")
if Switch1_State == 'off':
    Switch1_State=0
else:
    Switch1_State=1
```
In appdaemon you can also set the sate by `self.turn_on('input_boolean.Switch1')` which you would call if a condition was met

## input_number
input_numbers are used to store values - https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/input_number
these can either be displayed as a box or slider - see below.
This is also how you would make a dummy sensor, where the input_number is what updates the sensor value
```
input_number:
  slider1:
    name: Slider
    initial: 0
    min: 0
    max: 255
    step: 1
  box1:
    name: Numeric Input Box
    initial: 22
    min: -20
    max: 99
    step: 0.1
    mode: box
```
the minimum requirements are:
```
input_number:
  Slider1:
    min: -10
    max: 99
```
In appdaemon you can get the value using get state i.e `self.get_state("input_number.Slider1")` to convert from a string to a float for serial you can call `float(self.get_state("input_number.Slider1"))`
and like wise to set the value you can call `self.set_value('input_number.Slider1')`
** See 4. Serial - Arduino Python Home Assistant.md for more detail and use

## Sensors
Used to diplay your data on a chart etc. - https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/sensor
```
sensor:
  - platform: template
    sensors:
      sensor1:
        friendly_name: "Water Sensor"
        value_template:"{{ states('input_number.Slider1') }}"
```
In the example above as the sensor is called from the input_number you do not need to use this in appdaemon, but weould follow the same process if needed.

###### To display a sensor in a time format you can add the following to the value template:

```diff
# NOTE:
# - define durations for the various UNITs of time
#   * modulus helps to reduce ""extras"" of the larger time units
# 
# - now build the string
#
# for each UNIT of time that's greater than 1:
#     if it's not the first loop iteration:
#         append "", "" to the string
#     else:
#         1. convert the DURATION to STR
#         2. split DURATION on "".""
#         3. append the left part (the whole number) to the string
#         4. append the UNIT to the string
#
# ...but if that's no UNITs, then we just started so
# set the string to ""just now""
#

sensor:
  - platform: template
    sensors:
#main Panel
      TimeInput:
        friendly_name: "Time"
        value_template: >-
          {%- set uptime  = states.input_number.TimeInput | round -%}
          {%- set sep     = ', ' -%}
          {%- set TIME_MAP = {
              'week': (uptime / 10080) % 10080,
               'day': (uptime / 1440) % 7,
              'hour': (uptime / 60) % 24,
            'minute': (uptime % 60)
          }
          -%}

          {%- for unit, duration in TIME_MAP.items() if duration >= 1 -%}
            {%- if not loop.first -%}
              {{ sep }}
            {%- endif -%}
              
            {{ (duration | string).split('.')[0] }} {{ unit }}

            {%- if duration >= 2 -%}
              s
            {%- endif -%}
          {%- endfor -%}

          {%- if uptime < 1 -%}
            0
          {%- endif -%}
```
