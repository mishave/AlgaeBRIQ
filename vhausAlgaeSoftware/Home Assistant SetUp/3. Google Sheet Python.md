## Setup app.yaml to see your file
you can do this after of before but you need to know what your .py file is to be called as well as your class to be called, for example:
```diff
---                         # At the top of the file, doesnt need to be done each time you make a new setup
upDateSheet:                # this can be called what ever you like
    module: upDateMySheet   # this is what your python file .py has to be named
    class: upDateTheSheet   # this is the class to be called inside the .py
```
## Create your .py file and name the same as the module above i.e upDateMySheet.py
```diff
import appdaemon.plugins.hass.hassapi as hass
import gspread
from oauth2client.service_account import ServiceAccountCredentials
import datetime
import json

#
# description of what your doing

# Args:

class TurnOffPBR(hass.Hass):

    def initialize(self):
        self.listen_state(self.pbr_off_turn_off,"input_boolean.switch1", new='on', old='off')
        
    def pbr_off_turn_off(self, entity, attribute, old, new, kwargs):
        self.run_in(self.search, 2)
        
        # use creds to create a client to interact with the Google Drive API
        scope = ['https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds',
                 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive']
        creds = ServiceAccountCredentials.from_json_keyfile_name('/share/NameThisYourCredFileName.json', scope) # change to name of your file
        client = gspread.authorize(creds)
        fmt = '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'
        d = datetime.datetime.now()
        d_string = d.strftime(fmt)
        
        val1 = self.get_state("input_boolean.switch1")
        val2 = "123"

        sheet = client.open("nameThisyouGoogleSheetName").sheet1   #change to name of your sheet
        
        row = [d_string,val1,val2]
        index = 1
        sheet.insert_row(row, index, value_input_option='USER_ENTERED')
        
        
    def search(self, kwargs):
        #self.set_textvalue("input_text.text1", "hello world")
        self.turn_off("input_boolean.switch1")
```
## Note You Need To Set Up Any Entities You Are Calling From Home Assistant
in this case we used `input_boolean.switch1` therefor to use it we need to make sure its in our configuration.yaml file.
```diff
#Boolean Switches to be used as control for system
input_boolean:
  switch1:
    initial: off
```
